    <h1>Volleyball</h1>
    <p>Volleyball is the game I enjoyed playing the most in my entire childhood</p>
    <p>I have participated at inter school tournaments, and other small tournaments too</p>
    <p>The game consists of a few techniques: Passing,Serving,Setting,Blocking and Digging </p>
    <p>To become a pro one should master these techniques</p>
    <h3>Drills:</h3>
    <p>Wall drills: Bump, set, and dig against a wall to improve hand positioning and control</p> 
    <p>Pepper: A back-and-forth warm-up involving bump, set, and spike to build coordination</p> 
    <p>Target serving: Aim at marked spots on the court to build accuracy</p> 
    <p>Reactive drills: Partner tosses or cones for moving to hit low balls (angle digs)</p>
